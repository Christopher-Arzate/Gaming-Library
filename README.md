# Gaming-Library

## Summary
This repository holds my code and documents of my library of games and their cost throughout the month of January-February. This project was inspired after learning about API through DataCamp. The purpose of the project was to track the prices and discounts of my favorite games from different game stores and find which game stores provided the cheapest games to buy from.
