# Gaming-Library

## Summary
This repository holds my code and documents of my library of games and their cost throughout the month of January-February. This project was inspired after learning about API through DataCamp. The purpose of the project was to track the prices and discounts of my favorite games from different game stores and find which game stores provided the cheapest games to buy from.

## Order to look thought
I recommend looking into the technical report if you want to know I collected and organized data. Then, if you want to see the statistics of prices of different games, you can look into library analysis report. The report is quite long going to in detail of each game in my library. I also have code for a simple dashboard for people who don't want to read the report. You will need the python packages used in the code to see the dashboard.
